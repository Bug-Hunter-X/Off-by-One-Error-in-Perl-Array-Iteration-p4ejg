This repository contains a Perl code example demonstrating a common off-by-one error during array iteration. The bug.pl file showcases the error, while bugSolution.pl provides the corrected code.  The error stems from incorrect handling of array indices when using a `foreach` loop and `$#array`.  The solution demonstrates the correct way to iterate and access elements using the array's size or using a more idiomatic Perl approach.
